### ME 343 Machine Learning for Mechanical Engineers

Winter 2019

Welcome to this class. We hope you will enjoy it!

This is the first time this class is offered by the Mechanical Engineering Department so we will be experimenting with the content a bit. Here is the tentative schedule. We will make some adjustments as we go depending on interest and the time left:

- Gaussian process regression.
- Support vector machine for classification; kernel machines
- Deep learning
- Recurrent neural network
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- Physics-informed learning machines (a new method specific to ME!)
- Reinforcement learning
- Markov decision processes, Bellman equation, Monte-Carlo tree search, and dynamic programming
- Temporal-difference learning (if time allows)

We currently planned for 3 homework assignments, on kernel machines, GANs, and reinforcement learning.

There will be a final report due on Wednesday March 20, 11:59 PM.

The teaching staff:

- Main instructor: Eric Darve, darve@stanford.edu
- Lecturer: Hojat Ghorbanidehno, hojjatgh@stanford.edu
- TA: Ziyi Yang, ziyi.yang@stanford.edu
