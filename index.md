# ME 343 Homepage

Welcome to this class. We hope you will enjoy it!

This is the first time this class is offered by the Mechanical Engineering Department so we will be experimenting with the content a bit. Here is the tentative content. We will make some adjustments as we go depending on interest and time left:

- Gaussian process regression
- Support vector machine for classification; kernel machines
- Deep learning
- Recurrent Neural Network
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- Physics-informed learning machines (a new method specific to ME!)
- Reinforcement learning
- Markov decision processes, Bellman equation, Monte-Carlo tree search, and dynamic programming
- Temporal-difference learning (if time allows)

The material for this class is hosted on github. It can be downloaded from the main repository page

- Intermediate review paper; [Introduction to Gaussian Processes](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/teaching/KernelsICS273B/gpB.pdf) by Mackay
- Intermediate review paper; [Prediction with Gaussian Processes from Linear Regression to Linear Prediction and Beyond](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.84.1226&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Williams
- Longer review paper with an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level; [Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/161301/files/bayesgp-tut.pdf) by Seeger
