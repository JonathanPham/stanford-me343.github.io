## ME 343 Homepage

Welcome to this class. We hope you will enjoy it!

This is the first time this class is offered by the Mechanical Engineering Department so we will be experimenting with the content a bit. Here is the tentative content. We will make some adjustments as we go depending on interest and time left:

- Gaussian process regression
- Support vector machine for classification; kernel machines
- Deep learning
- Recurrent Neural Network
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- Physics-informed learning machines (a new method specific to ME!)
- Reinforcement learning
- Markov decision processes, Bellman equation, Monte-Carlo tree search, and dynamic programming
- Temporal-difference learning (if time allows)

The material for this class is hosted on github. It can be downloaded from the main repository page

 If you click on the green button "Clone or download" you can download all the files as a zip archive.

### Reading material

### GPR

- [Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/) by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams, The MIT Press, 2006. ISBN 0-262-18253-X. This is a reference textbook on Gaussian Processes. Very extensive. Everything you ever wanted to know about GPR.
- Short review paper; [Gaussian Processes for Regression](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1048-gaussian-processes-for-regression.pdf) by Williams and Rasmussen
- Intermediate review paper; [Introduction to Gaussian Processes](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/teaching/KernelsICS273B/gpB.pdf) by Mackay
- Intermediate review paper; [Prediction with Gaussian Processes from Linear Regression to Linear Prediction and Beyond](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.84.1226&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Williams
- Longer review paper with an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level; [Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/161301/files/bayesgp-tut.pdf) by Seeger

### SVM

- [A tutorial on support vector regression](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:STCO.0000035301.49549.88) by Smola and Scholkopf
- [A Tutorial on Support Vector Machines for Pattern
Recognition](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1009715923555) by Burges. They have a very interesting mechanical analogy in terms of force and torque for the separating hyperplane.
